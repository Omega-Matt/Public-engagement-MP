<h3>Game Objectives:</h3>
<div id="p1">
    The aim of the game is to make, as much clean water as you can within 2 minutes.
</div>

<div id="p2">
    Water is sent to the tank when the water quality is good. (This gives you points).
    Water is sent to waste if the water quality is bad. (This doesn't give points).
</div>

<div id="p3">
    You can change the water quality by using the arrows to Add or Remove
    Flocculant from the water.
</div>

<div id="p4">
    If your tank runs out of water, the game is over!
    (Keep your filter clean, so your flow of water is high.)
